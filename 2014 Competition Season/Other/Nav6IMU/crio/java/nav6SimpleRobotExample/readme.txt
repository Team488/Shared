In order to use the nav6.jar file in a FRC Java project, follow these steps:

- Locate the nav6.jar file, which is at:

   <svnroot>/crio/java/nav6/dist/nav6.jar

- Copy the nav6.jar file to your sunspotfrcsdk directory.  
This directory is typically located in your home directory.

- Once the nav6.jar file is copied to your sunspotfrcsdk 
directory, you should be able to compile your java application 
and use the class provided in the nav6.jar file.

As an alternate approach, you can choose to copy the java source 
code files directory into your project files.  The source code 
files are located at:

  <svnroot>/crio/java/nav6/src
